As you wonder through Brockton point, you'll come across a celtic cross hidden in the forest adjacent to the road.  This space is negelcted, the cross doesn't seemed to be maintained, and if you are walking along the sea wall, you will barely see it. I've chosen to create my intervention here as there is a potential to create a space for shelter and rest, to create an area of landscape appreciation and education, and to enhance an area of cultural and historical reflection.

As of now, it is over grown in shrubs and primary successional species such as alders and maples. For the intervention, the center of the site will have a western red cedar <em>Thuja plicata</em> planted as a living monument, symbolising the importance of cedar trees to first nations that have lived in this valley. This area will be enclosed in the already existing trees in the area which will eventually turn into old growth. Native shrubs will be planted in the perimeter to also symbolise the importance of the cultural uses of these plants. Benches will be strategically placed for people to sit, rest, and reflect.

Unlike most physical memorials that commemorate the past, using a tree as a living monument can be seen as a juxtaposition, an anti-monument perhaps; as time moves forward, the monument will grow and its meaning can and will evolve alongside with the tree.

Stanley Park has witnessed community eviction, human-wildlife conflicts, and cultural assimilation, severing a social connection between humans and the local environment. I want to re-design a section in Stanley Park that allows an area for shelter and rest, an area of landscape appreciation and education, and enhance an already-existing area of cultural and historical reflection. Focusing on these 3 factors will allow visitors and locals to come together and help foster dialogue in reconciliation.
